# Data and code to generate figures for the manuscript 'Microbial population shifts during disturbance induced foaming in anaerobic digestion of primary and activated sludge'

This repository was set up to facilitate collaboration in a project at the ARC Transforming Biosolids Training Centre, Melbourne Australia. 
The masterdata and code can be used to replicate the figures for our publication, available at [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.123548](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.123548).
